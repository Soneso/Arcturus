        absBefore:
          type: string
          description: Optional. A customized ISO 8601 formatted string representing a deadline for when the claimable balance can be claimed. If the balance is claimed before the date then this clause of the condition is satisfied. The format of this date string is a custom extension on top of ISO 8601 format. It allows for years to be outside the 0000-9999 range. The dates are derived from a unix epoch value in range of signed 64 bit integer. This means the date expresses a much larger calendar range of 292277026596 years into future and -292471206707 years back in past. This custom extension format will add a '+' prefix on values that go beyond year 9999 into the future and for years that are prior to year 0(B.C per Gregorian calendar) it will add prefix of '-'. Here are examples of date string values that are possible '2022-02-10T15:30:22Z', '+39121901036-03-29T15:30:22Z', '-7025-12-23T00:00:00Z'

          type: string
          description: Optional. A unix epoch value in seconds representing the same deadline date for when the claimable balance can be claimed. It is the same date/time value that absBefore represents, just expressed in integral unix epoch seconds within the range of a signed 64bit integer.
        relBefore:
          type: string
          description: Optional. A relative deadline for when the claimable balance can be claimed. The value represents the number of seconds since the close time of the ledger which created the claimable balance.
