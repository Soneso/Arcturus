    get:
      operationId: getEncodedMuxedAccount
      summary: Generates a muxed account id by combining the given stellar account id and user id (numeric). A muxed account allows a single stellar account id to be shared across many users.
      description: A stellar account is identified by its account id. However, muxed accounts introduce an additional level of abstraction by allowing a single account to have multiple sub-accounts, each identified by a shorter muxed account id. This endpoint creates the muxed account Id by the given parameters.
